Kerbal Space Program - Mission Control
==================

This project aims at providing external mission control capability to Kerbal Space Program.
The project consists (at the moment) of two parts: 
* A KSP plugin which listens to incoming TCP connections and streams live vessel updates to any connected sockets.
* Python pygame -based client that visualizes the data in various ways, including ground tracks and orbit plots.

The network protocol needs still standardization. Perhaps it can be used by other apps and software too.

Contributors are welcome!
